## Intro
Our world's climate is constantly changing, and understanding these changes is critical to mitigating the potential harm to our planet and its inhabitants. In this project, we utilized various machine learning models to forecast changes in global temperature, both on land and sea, as well as predict sea level rise. By examining data from sources such as NOAA, datahub.io, kaggle, climate.gov, and others, we aimed to better understand how global emissions, glacier melt, and other factors could impact climate change.

## Overview
Our project began by compiling data on temperature change, historical sea level change, annual global emissions, and glacier melt over time to input into our models. We utilized a variety of machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, ridge regression, and neural network models, to forecast and predict these changes. Our goal with these predictions was to better understand the potential impact of increased sea level and temperature, such as population displacement in coastal areas and the increase in severe climate-related natural disasters.

## Limitations
One significant limitation of our project was the data itself. To develop a fully-formed model, we would require much more data, which would likely have an impact on our predictions. Additionally, our data only extended to 2014, so any new changes made regarding electric and green energy are not accounted for in our emissions numbers.

### Libraries Used
Our project utilized a variety of Python libraries, including:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Plotly

## Conclusion
All of our machine learning models predicted a continuation of the trend of increased temperatures and higher sea levels. This trend will most likely result in more severe weather and climate disasters, including hurricane damage, famine from drought, and other severe weather associated with those factors. By utilizing machine learning models, we can better understand the impact of climate change and take steps towards mitigating potential harm.


## Climate Change - Ridge Regression

- Global temperature has increased significantly since the beginning of the 1900's.
- Global emissions show a mostly gradual incline from the 1700s to the 1900s. Then, an explosive increase from a specific group of countries.
